# Optical-Illusions
---
This repository is created with the intention of illustrating optical illusions that I collect from the internet and code myself.

[Circle Projections](https://github.com/bomberedoc/Visual-Illusions/blob/master/Circle%20Projection%20Illusion.py) is the first python file added to this repo. This is an illusion where the small points appear to be constituting a circle whereas they are simply projections of a point on the circumference of a circle onto different diameters of the circle. Use 's' to toggle between outer circle/no outer circle. Use up/down arrow to increase/decrease number of smaller circles used as projections.

Required modules: Pygame, Math.

[Motion Induced Blindness](https://github.com/bomberedoc/Optical-Illusions/blob/master/Motion%20Induced%20Blindness.js) is the second file added in this repo. This illustrates some motion and four dots, three of which are stationary and the other one flashes after regular intervals. While fixating on the flashing dot, the stationary dots may disappear due to the brain prioritizing motion information. 

This is coded in p5.js, a javascript library. You need an index file along linking to [this file](https://github.com/bomberedoc/Optical-Illusions/blob/master/Motion%20Induced%20Blindness.js) and a link to the p5 library to successfully run this. Change the frame rate in the file accordingly to get the besat illustration.

Will add gifs of these illustrations here in future.
