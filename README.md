# Optical-Illusions
---
This repository is created with the intention of adding visual illusions in future.

---
[Circle Projections](https://github.com/bomberedoc/Visual-Illusions/blob/master/Circle%20Projection%20Illusion.py) is the first python file added to this repo. This is an illusion where the small points appear to be constituting a circle whereas they are simply projections of a point on the circumference of a circle onto different diameters of the circle. Use 's' to toggle between outer circle/no outer circle. Use up/down arrow to increase/decrease number of smaller circles used as projections.
Required modules: Pygame, Math.
